      <h3>Listen Up, Future Top Dog:</h3>
      <p>Here's the deal:</p>
      <p>There are two ways you can live your life.</p>
      <p><u>The first option</u> is to hide from your aspirations and play it safe.</p>
      <p>You can stay with the jobs, the people, and the body you can’t stand in the mirror because that’s what you feel you deserve.</p>
      <p>You can continue to chase women and bore them with your over-thought-out pickup lines and insecure “head games”&mdash;but you’ll only be playing yourself.</p>
      <p>In fact, the longer you ignore the fact your life lacks purpose, the more it stabs your consciousness when you look back at the opportunities you have missed&mdash;years and decades later.</p>
      <p>Maybe you’ve already experienced that, and as a result, you might already be coping with that lack of meaning by drinking, getting fat, or using drugs excessively.</p>
      <p><u>The second option</u> is to grab your balls and seize the day, starting today.</p>
      <p>Train your body and mold your mind with heterodox philosophies to escape western degeneracy&mdash;and master the challenges of our time.</p>
      <p>Live on your own terms.</p>
      <p>Clutch your destiny from the jaws of failure. And “ride the wave” until your life is filled with only the very best experiences any true man can have in life.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Now...</em></strong> I can NOT help you play it safe and never dare to dream. But if you trust me, I can help you have the courage to choose your best life.</p>
      <p>I can only promise you one thing: I will help you learn the tools of physical fitness and mental fortitude, borne out of a radical and comprehensive personal philosophy, that will arm you to be the ultimate survival machine in the “wilderness” of our modern times.</p>
      <p>You’ll have to do the work&mdash;by climbing the mountain to become its master.</p>
      <p>But once you ascend those unforgiving rocky heights and stand at the peak, you can breathe in the rarified air that so few men have ever tasted.</p>
      <p>And you will know the sweet victory that comes from rising up to live your life with deep meaning and purpose.</p>

      <h2>What This is NOT:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Gimmicky, and eye-rollingly obvious lifting “advice” from 'roid-logged' Instagram influencers. (We’ve actually worked out with top bodybuilders and read their programs in excruciating detail to give you extraordinary results&mdash;FAST.)</li>
        <li>Regurgitation of “lamestream” political, financial, and career advice (ala Peterson, Tomassi, et al.)</li>
        <li>Part of the Red-Pill “mainstream” brought to you by has-been grifters who are clearly washed up and faking it.</li>
        <li>A safe place for Normtards, Boomers, Non-Lifters, and Illiterates.</li>
        <li>Life coaching in the traditional sense. No. This is total, REAL transformation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>...But you already knew none of those things were going to help you self-actualize and build muscle anyways.</h3>

      <h3>Student Spotlight:</h3>
      <h2>“This is basically what he is trying to do – help depressed men from trying to pull the trigger and ushering in meaningful change into their lives.”</h2>
      <p>I started coaching calls with GLO 6 months ago. Over time, he encouraged me to read Zizek’s “Welcome to the Desert of the Real” and books on fitness. He shared videos and articles which we sat down and discussed in detail. Whenever I’d ask him basic questions like “Hey, my heart is broken, wtf do I do?”, he never gave me normative responses. There are no straight short-cuts and red pills you can ingest to push out all the feminized traits you’ve been conditioned into over the course of your life. Learning comes slow. Here are some of the things you can expect:</p>
      <h4>1) Value-driven discussions and approaching the source:</h4>
      <p>He will sit down and argue with you about things he has asked you to read/watch. If he is spending an hour or two a week with you, he tries his best to give you that hour’s worth of value, and he will constantly readjust the frame of the discussion in order to ascertain that you are, in fact, getting your value for your dollar. He will get you out of reading shitty derivative blog posts and actually read the source material, ranging from philosophy to fitness.</p>

      <h4>2) Tailored to your perspective:</h4>
      <p>We are very different human beings. We’ve talked about the utility of religion for months, and he has successfully lifted me out of the nihilism phase where my lack of structure was threatening to destabilize me completely. The importance of having and embracing structures is something that has helped me a lot over the last few months of being depressed. Also, it doesn’t matter how smart/stupid you are, he will talk to you at your level and try to get you to a better mental framework/intellectual level.</p>
  
      <h4>3) Workouts:</h4>
      <p>I feel like I don’t really have to mention this, but he will write down personal workouts for you that will focus on what your personal bodily needs are. In the last 4 months, I have put on a good amount of muscle and the confidence shows in how people treat me in real life. I have matured into 4 days a week workouts, that specifically address my personal physical growth.</p>

      <h4>4) Personal life examples:</h4>
      <p>Whenever I hit a roadblock and felt extremely depressed regarding life and my unicorn oneitis, He would prop up his own shitty examples of where he came from, how he started. His real-life examples have helped me realize that we are all ultimately human.</p>
      <p>While he always has a no-nonsense attitude regarding our sessions, he understands emasculated men, and how absolutely mentally crippled some of us are. Talking to him helped me realize how many personal sacrifices come before one is able to lift themselves into a better life, where you don’t spend hours each day planning to blow out your brains.</p>

      <h4>5) This is just the starting point:</h4>
      <p>Ultimately, GLO isn’t selling you the red pill; his traditional course is designed to go beyond that. Essentially, he will encourage you to embrace critical thinking in your own lives and help you get to a better place. Coaching is meant to make you into a stronger individual, physically and mentally.</p>
      <p>I have a long way to go, and I understand that change comes slowly and that creating a purpose for myself will take time. I want to get there, and he has provided great inertia that I honestly was lacking for years.</p>
      <p>While he does get paid for his coaching, my interactions with him have taught me this – He believes that a real alpha (he hates the alpha/beta dichotomy btw, and his usage is mostly ironic) is someone who tries to help people and make their lives better. This is basically what he is trying to do – help depressed men from trying to pull the trigger and ushering in meaningful change into their lives.</p>

      <h2>“I’d be missing the lateral thinking aspect, how one set of ideas related to another. How ideas of the left and the right can be synthesized to create new possibilities.”</h2>
      <h4>What was your first impression of your GLO Philosophy coaching calls?</h4>
      <p>My first impression was that the man was cool, but I already knew that cause I read the posts. He’s also 100 years ahead of everyone intellectually. The workouts are also an integral part of my life and the best bodybuilding programming I’ve ever encountered. I’m almost ashamed to take off my shirt cause I’m too beautiful.</p>

      <h4>What do you mean by 100 years ahead of everyone intellectually? He’s obviously very well-read. Is that the extent of it? Accumulation of knowledge?</h4>
      <p>Yeah. His depth of study is unmatched by academia.</p>

      <h4>Let’s imagine for a moment that we’ve gone back in time before your first calls, and imagine that you decided to do the readings without ever contacting GLO Philosophy for coaching. What would be missing in your understanding of the material?</h4>
      <p>I’d be missing the lateral thinking aspect, how one set of ideas related to another. How ideas of the left and the right can be synthesized to create new possibilities. How philosophy relates to psychoanalysis, and seamlessly tie in together. I was also exposed to a lot of concepts that I was personally in search of for a long time.</p>
      <p>All I knew was that something was wrong and I was inconsolably upset about the trajectory that conventional wisdom would have me take. But I needed someone who’s actively tackling these problems to fully understand and develop perspective. I wanted some dense challenging material to study. I hated school cause I felt like I was being babysat with a bunch of dumb kids.</p>

      <h4>Some of his clients are young men navigating their place in the sexual marketplace and are learning how to get their needs with girls met— have the concepts you’ve learned in the readings helped you in this arena of your life?</h4>
      <p>Becoming fluent in psychoanalysis and philosophy basically makes you the Terminator. I could AMOG the president and take his bitch. It also made me a better writer. I was writing and doing stand-up before I called.</p>

      <h4>So, say... 2 years ago, before you got coaching, paint me a picture of what your life was like. A day in the life of you back then compared to today... after all you’ve learned and your body improving through the fitness regimen.</h4>
      <p>2 years ago, shitty, I was trying to figure out how to get through the day and practice performing without talking to anyone. I felt deeply alienated cause all I cared about was developing my skills, and normal people are more interested in party drugs. I was in decent shape but needed advanced instruction. The best I could do on my own. Now I’m teaching philosophy and writing professionally. I have loads of ideas for creative work and am a certified qt pie, cause my physique is unbelievable.</p>

      <h4>When you mention alienation and how all the normal people all around you were more interested in partying and drugs. I think about how the private forum is the polar opposite of that situation. I think it can be very lonely when you’re surrounded by people you can’t relate to at all. What’s different about the private forum, compared to like... the comment sections of Reddit, or even your own real-life friend group?</h4>
      <p>Everything. It’s intellectually rigorous and unpretentious.</p>

      <h2>Why I’m Doing This</h2>
      <p>In 2014 I got bored of watching YouTube videos and playing StarCraft 2 so I started Skyping dudes playing recreational therapist. I thought that would be more entertaining like a reality TV video game.</p>
      <p>Anyway, I Skyped close to 1000 people in 5 years. Law school sort of prepared me for manipulating dudes out of depression and into the gym. I know this community better than anyone. That’s because I’ve actually had the pleasure to speak with them individually.</p>
      <p>If I called anyone a faggot retard it’s because I actually care a lot. I want to slap the kids here awake because there is a huge bullshit train coming right at them and they need to save themselves.</p>
